PYHTON CAR GAME

Welcome to the adrenaline-pumping world of our Python car game where users are able to test how good their reflexes are in dodging an AIcar as many times as possible. This python car game was developed by a team of Christiana Madubuike, Afolabi Fatai Kayode and myself. In our group of three, we worked collaboratively to develop the Python car game. While I took the lead in implementing the game mechanics, graphics and overall development, my teammates actively provided feedback, suggestions, and assistance throughout the entire process.

PURPOSE

The purpose of the Python car game is to provide an entertaining and engaging gaming experience where players control a car on a road, avoiding collisions with AI-controlled cars. The game challenges players to navigate the car through the road, demonstrating their skills in maneuvering and avoiding obstacles.
